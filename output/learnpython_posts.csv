1o13u6i,Can a beginner realistically build this kind of automation project in Python?,HarouneBoulahdjel,12,20,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o13u6i/can_a_beginner_realistically_build_this_kind_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o13u6i/can_a_beginner_realistically_build_this_kind_of/,2025-10-08T07:19:04,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently learning Python and using Exercism to practice (just started). I had an idea for a project that could help me automate a data-entry and reporting process I deal with often at work.

The idea is to create an app where users can fill in fields like company details, partners/shareholders, financial info, etc., and the app would automatically generate a formatted report in PDF or Word (there are also some financial calculations that I wanna organize  in a table, but nothing complex) 

Later on, I’d like to add features like:
  - User authentication (admin/editor/viewer roles)
  - The ability to save drafts and edit reports
  - Autofill data from previously entered records
  - Possibly connect it to external systems or databases. 

I also made a flowchart diagram showing how data would move from input → validation → report generation → storage.

I’m wondering:

       	- Is this too ambitious for a beginner, or doable if I take it step-by-step? (I am in no rush, I feel that learning by doing is much better, but I want to hear opinions of people that know better than me and learn from you guys) 

        - Should I finish all Exercism exercises first, or start building while I learn?

         - Any libraries or frameworks you’d recommend for this kind of project (like for PDFs, databases, or a simple UI)?

Would really appreciate your thoughts and advice — thanks!"

1o15ydc,Deploying project into production with specific dependency versions?,pachura3,3,10,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o15ydc/deploying_project_into_production_with_specific/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o15ydc/deploying_project_into_production_with_specific/,2025-10-08T09:39:20,"Let's say my `pyproject.toml` contains the following dependency:

    dependencies = [
        ""flask&gt;=3.0.0"",
    ]

This means that if there is no `uv.lock` nor `requirements.txt` file present, installing my module will simply download the latest Flask version - `3.1.2`.

To avoid dependency hell, I run `uv lock` which creates `uv.lock` file with fixed Flask version - let's say, `3.1.0`. This works well during the development, however when I finally build a wheel file to be deployed into production, its `dist-info/METADATA` only contains entry `Requires-Dist: flask&gt;=3.0.0`. So, again, if I install the compiled WHL into an empty `.venv`, it will fetch `Flask 3.1.2`, not `3.1.0` as preferred.

How shall this be managed? Should `uv.lock` file be distributed together with the wheel file? Is there some way to express preferred dependency versions when project is used on its own? Or should they be fixed in `pyproject.toml` instead of using the `&gt;=` notation?"

1o0drhh,How do you deal with the fact that Linux distros like Debian/Ubuntu want to own python libs?,ratttertintattertins,57,69,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o0drhh/how_do_you_deal_with_the_fact_that_linux_distros/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o0drhh/how_do_you_deal_with_the_fact_that_linux_distros/,2025-10-07T12:45:26,"I find this really annoying.  Both `pip` and `Debian` want to be the owner of my python packages.  Debian always has about 50% of the packages I want and it never has the latest versions.  If I try to use `pip` it warns me that I'll need to use `--break-system-packages` if I want to use it.

So I end up sometimes breaking system packages to get the packages I want and then I find myself stuck because the two sets of packages will start to conflict with each other.  I'd really rather the whole thing was managed by `pip` (except that I can understand that certain aspects of the OS are likely depending on the debian one).

What's the sanest way to handle this?  I'm starting to think I should be using two entirely seperate python installations.  One for the system and one for my dev.  Is that what most people do?"
1o16jlq,"Odd behaviour in PyQt ""connect"" code",magus_minor,1,1,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o16jlq/odd_behaviour_in_pyqt_connect_code/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o16jlq/odd_behaviour_in_pyqt_connect_code/,2025-10-08T10:15:56,"**Can anyone throw some light on what I'm seeing?**  Using Linux Mint and Python 3.12.3.

I've been using the `connect()` method of widgets in PyQt for a long time without any problem.  But I've run into something that *used* to work (I think).

When creating functions in a loop and passing the loop index as a parameter to the function I've always used the `lambda x=i: f(x)` idiom as the connect function.  The point is to force an evaluation of the `i` value to defeat the late evaluation of `i` in the lambda closure.  This has worked well.  I don't like the `functools.partial()` approach to solving this problem.  Here's a bit of vanilla code that creates four functions, passing the loop variable to the function.  The three lines in the loop show the naive, failing approach, then the ""x=i"" approach, and then the partial() approach:

    from functools import partial
    funcs = []
    for i in range(4):
        #funcs.append(lambda: print(i))             # prints all 3s (as expected)
        #funcs.append(lambda x=i: print(x))         # prints 0, 1, 2, 3
        funcs.append(partial(lambda i: print(i), i))# prints 0, 1, 2, 3
    for f in funcs:
        f()

Run that with the first line uncommented and you see the 3, 3, 3, 3 output expected due to the closure late binding.  The second line using the `x=i` approach works as expected, as does the third `partial()` approach.

I was just writing some PyQt5 code using a loop to create buttons and passing the loop index to the button ""connect"" handler with the `x=i` approach but I got very strange results.  This small executable example shows the problem, with three lines, one of which should be uncommented, as in the above example code:

    from functools import partial
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QGridLayout, QPushButton, QWidget

    class Test(QWidget):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

            layout = QGridLayout()
            for i in range(4):
                button = QPushButton(f""{i}"")
                #button.clicked.connect(lambda: self.btn_clicked(i))    # all buttons print 3 (as expected)
                #button.clicked.connect(lambda x=i: self.btn_clicked(x))# all buttons print False (!?)
                button.clicked.connect(partial(self.btn_clicked, i))   # prints 0, 1, 2, 3
                layout.addWidget(button, i, 0)

            self.setLayout(layout)
            self.show()

        def btn_clicked(self, arg):
            print(f""{arg} clicked."")

    app = QApplication([])
    window = Test()
    window.show()
    app.exec()

With the first naive line uncommented the buttons 0, 1, 2, 3 all print 3, 3, 3, 3, as expected.  With the `partial()` line uncommented I get the expected 0, 1, 2, 3 output.  But with the `x=i` line the argument printed is always `False`.  I am using the `partial()` approach of course, but I'm just curious as to what is happening.  In my recollection the `x=i` approach used to work in PyQt."
1o12jkz,Injecting build date automatically when building WHL ?,pachura3,2,0,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o12jkz/injecting_build_date_automatically_when_building/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o12jkz/injecting_build_date_automatically_when_building/,2025-10-08T05:59:10,"I have a simple Python project that is often updated, so I need to track its version number and display it in the runtime.

    __version__ = ""1.0.6""
    __date__ = ""2025-10-08 18:33""

This works well, however, when I'm just about to build the wheel file, I need to update these 2 values manually. For `__version__` I don't mind, but can `__date__` be somehow set automatically?

I build my project simply with `python -m build --wheel`. Below are the relevant sections of my `pyproject.toml`. I don't have `setup,py` file at all.

    [project]
    name = ""MyProject""
    dynamic = [""version""]

Sorry if this is long and confusing. I'm working at a place that is very guarded about installing software. They have an application or network (don't know which is correct terminology) hosting software that is approved. Python 3.10 and 3.12 are there, and so is spyder. No Anaconda. 


So I download 3.10 and spyder and open spyder and it is running Python 3.8. I also find it has a number of libraries I wanted like numpy, pandas, scipy. Great. It doesn't seem to have pip though. 


So I check out the 3.10 download just through python command window or whatever and it has none of those packages, but does have pip. So now I'm pretty confused. I would like to run Python in spyder but be able to create virtual environments with other versions of Python and the libraries I need. I'm told I have to get each one approved. 


So my real question is why does spyder have a Python install with a ton of libraries? I thought it was just an IDE. Why is it running a version of python I did not install directly? Is there something I can do to get the libraries I need to work with other versions of Python? I don't really know what I'm doing, I just use it as a tool. But I would like to understand what is happening. Thank you in advance for your help. "

Both official docs for `typing.Counter` and `collections.Counter` do not specify the number of arguments the type hint should take.

`typing.Counter` is deprecated to begin with, with no details other than inheritence from `collections.Counter` and `dict`

`collections.Counter` on the other hand has a full-on implementation without mentioning type hints.

Given `collections.Counter` is a `dict` sub-class per docs, I used `Counter[str, int]` as a type hint, which turned out to be wrong.

I figured `Counter[str]` would make more sense since `int` is implicitly there for a counter, but this should be explicit info, not deducable from clues.

Another question might help, what is \`mypy\` using as a source to reach it's type hint conclusions?

I believe I'm missing something here so please help me out.

PS: bonus question, should I use the super class `dict` for type hints, instead of the more-specific `Counter`?

So I will need to update the code to use [Office365-REST-Python-Client](https://github.com/vgrem/Office365-REST-Python-Client) instead maybe?

Now, in order to get anything to authenticate I need to set the app up with access. I found this solution, [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly)

I read somewhere that the best way to get through this is to do the Azure AD Application Registration process. Generate your own self-signed certificate and add the certificate to the code.

My question is, is all of this necessary... all the code is doing is querying, downloading and uploading Sharepoint files and folders that my user account has access to.

Is there a simpler way?

Is there maybe a way to trick Sharepoint into thinking that the Python Script is me doing my normal clicking around in SharePoint with my user account so I can get around the authentication issues?

I don't mind if the script takes a couple of minutes to run instead of seconds.

Also I think even if I complete the update outlined here it will only work until April 2026 anyway yeah?"
1o04s72,Feels like I'm winging it with Trial and Error,Yelebear,4,21,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o04s72/feels_like_im_winging_it_with_trial_and_error/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1o04s72/feels_like_im_winging_it_with_trial_and_error/,2025-10-07T04:07:22,"So I was given a dictionary

    student_scores = {
        ""Harry"": 81,
        ""Ron"": 78,
        ""Hermione"": 99,
        ""Draco"": 74,
        ""Neville"": 62
    }

And the task was to print out the data, but replace the actual numeric scores with a grading system.

&amp;nbsp;

My solution was to create a separate dictionary, and an if code to sort through the numbers like so:

    student_scores = {
        ""Harry"": 81,
        ""Ron"": 78,
        ""Hermione"": 99,
        ""Draco"": 74,
        ""Neville"": 62
    }

    student_grades = {
    }

    for x in student_scores:
        if student_scores[x] &gt;= 91:
            grade = ""Outstanding""
        elif student_scores[x] &gt;= 81:
            grade = ""Exceeds Expectations""
        elif student_scores[x] &gt;= 71:
            grade = ""Acceptable""
        else:
            grade = ""Fail""
        
    for x in student_scores:
        student_grades[x] = grade

    print(student_grades)

It did not work. It just gave everyone a failing mark,

&amp;nbsp;

I fiddled around a bit, until by process of trial and error I arrived at a working solution, basically to combine the two for loops:

    student_scores = {
        ""Harry"": 81,
        ""Ron"": 78,
        ""Hermione"": 99,
        ""Draco"": 74,
        ""Neville"": 62
    }

    student_grades = {
    }

    for x in student_scores:
        if student_scores[x] &gt;= 91:
            grade = ""Outstanding""
        elif student_scores[x] &gt;= 81:
            grade = ""Exceeds Expectations""
        elif student_scores[x] &gt;= 71:
            grade = ""Acceptable""
        else:
            grade = ""Fail""
        student_grades[x] = grade

    print(student_grades)

Now, this makes sense in hindsight. Now that I'm looking at it, I kinda understand now how it's working. The two for loops are calling for the same thing, why even separate them?

But I hate how I arrived at the answer through a process of trial and error, instead of a ""light-bulb"" eureka moment. 

&amp;nbsp;

Idk my dudes. Hopefully this gets better, because I plan to move into more complex tests and soon.

Anyone else went through this stage when you were starting?"

I need to develop a game/simulation for a university unit that has a people walk randomly around an amusement park, line up for rides, enter rides, visually show them on the ride, then back to strolling around.

I am of the mind to use MapTile to create the map layers, pixel art tile sets for graphical features, sprites for the characters (sims) but am unsure if it is even possible to create interactive rides where those sims are represented on the rides.

If it is not possible (or too time intensive), I am considering have the rides with roofs so that the sims wait in the background (image underlay) for a set period of time before the ride does one full revolution and the sim is released (using start, stop, time steps).

Any insight from those that have programmed such functionality would also be welcomed to advise me of some potential limitations, hurdles, or pit-falls as this is my first game development."

But I dont fully understand how does DLLs get into the bundle, since Im getting this error of initializing DLLs when running my .exe file, and doing`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`  does not sound like the correct answer to the issue.

    OMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dll, but found libiomp5md.dll already initialized. 
    OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. 
    That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. 
    The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. 
    As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, 
    but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results. For more information, please see http://openmp.llvm.org/

I kept debugging and the issue relies specifically in **MKL** and **Pytorch** trying to load the same DLLs (**libiomp5md.dll**). In my local with Anaconda I could solve it by deleting the repeated files from the library folder, do I have to create a script to pause or remove the repeated DLLs when running my app? or is it a way to have better control of the DLLs that go into the bundle?"

It is crucial that only the program/script uses the credentials and no other human outside the dev department can read these files. Keychain also doesn’t work as the Windows application is not in use and won’t be.

After writing some scripts to automate boring and reoccurring tasks I finally hit the spot where a tasks requires me to log into a database or requires certain rights to achieve the goal. I have different service/bot users for this. Everything runs in Windows.

Which libraries can you recommend to store these login credentials as secure hashes or other methods? If you can recommend a tutorial in English, German or Italian I‘d also take the link to it. These parts of IT security are rather oblivious to me. I‘ll learn more about it in university in the upcoming months, but some basics would be great.

1nzgw05,How make data migration to PostgresSQL 16 faster?,Sweet_Sempai,2,13,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nzgw05/how_make_data_migration_to_postgressql_16_faster/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nzgw05/how_make_data_migration_to_postgressql_16_faster/,2025-10-06T11:51:51,"Hello everyone 

**TASK**

My task is to migrate files from GridFS to PostgreSQL.
In PostgreSQL, the database structure repeats the structure of GridFS - a table with file metadata (file) and an associated table with file chunks (chunk). Both tables use UUIDs as IDs based on the `ObjectId' from GridFS.

---

**SETUP**

To work with PostgreSQL, I use `Psycopg 3`, I run the migration itself through multiprocessing in 4 workers and use an asynchronous context inside. 
I pack the metadata into an in-memory csv for insertion using `COPY... FROM STDIN` since this method is considered the fastest for writing to PostgreSQL, I convert chunks to binary format and also copy using `COPY... FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY)` since this is considered the fastest way to write to the database.  
I get the data to write to the tables from the list generated by the code above. The list structure is as follows: 
```python
[(metadata_1, file_content_1), (metadata_2, file_content_2) ...]
```

---

**PROBLEM**

The problem is that it doesn't work out fast... The maximum write speed that I managed to achieve is 36GB per hour, while the average is about 21GB per hour. 
Writing chunks stops everything terribly, there is a long delay between the last `write` and `commit`, which I can't beat, but when writing chunks, workers write data one at a time, wait for the first one to finish writing and then one at a time, and this despite the fact that they write to different tables (more about this will be below)!
Do I lack the knowledge to figure out if this is my maximum or postgres maximum in terms of write speed?

---

**What I tried**

At the moment, I was uploading the following settings directly to the database on the server:
```SQL
wal_buffers = 128MB
shared_buffers = 1GB
max_wal_size = 4GB
synchronous_commit = off
fsync = off
```
There is a similar line in the script, but it does absolutely nothing when requested, so it's just a rudimentary thing.
In addition, I use temporary tables for writing, each worker has its own pair of `staging_file` and `staging_chunk` - where indexes and links are not used to speed up writing.
I tried to play with the size of the chunks, with the size of the batch chunks - but it also did not give any noticeable increase.
I did a commit for each batch, one commit for each batch, and it also didn't give any noticeable gain.

The part of the script responsible for writing to PostgreSQL: https://paste.pythondiscord.com/XNZA

Part of the code directly related to the bid itself:
```python
try:
        async with await psycopg.AsyncConnection.connect(
                f""postgresql://{user_pg}:{password_pg}@{ip_pg}:5432/{db_pg}""

Here’s basically what it does it does:  
1. Flips a virtual coin many times (`heads = +1`, `tails = –1`)  
2.  Tracks your position over time, that’s a “random walk”  
3.  Repeats thousands of walks, then plots the final positions

One path looks totally messy, but when you combine thousands, the chaos collapses into the familiar **bell curve**.

It was amazing to realize that a few lines of code show why randomness produces order

(I’m happy to share the Colab notebook if mods say that’s okay or if anyone wants it.)

I’d love feedback on how to make the code cleaner or more Pythonic in feel or ideas for the next visualization (maybe drift or volatility clustering, idk?)."

When looking at the above code I can see that it is not well written.

First there are multiple assertions in each test (which is not ideal, but not really what I'm concerned about here).

Secondly, I am using the fixture get_poses_left_front in the class TestRobotPosesLeftFront, and I am writing that explicitly and loading it explicitly for each of these tests, which seems like bad practice, however I don't see any good way around it.

I have been reading the docs, but I cannot see anything in there that might help me write the above test better.

How might I rewrite this in a better way?"

I am part of a data visualisation challenge and am using this as an opportunity to improve my Python knowledge. I'm using a specific set of fonts in my viz and font manager is always imported:

    from matplotlib.font_manager import FontProperties

Then I set my specific fonts with these:

    font1 = ""path to &gt; Gabarito-Bold-BF651cdf1f430c1.ttf""
    font_Gab = FontProperties(fname=font1, size=8)

While in the final viz the fonts appear as expected, I'm getting this error in VS Code's interactive window: 

`findfont: Font family 'path to &gt; Gabarito-Bold-BF651cdf1f430c1.ttf' not found.`

This is absolutely not correct. After a short search online, I deleted the fontlist cache in Users/myusername/.matplotlib but it's still repeating. In the font cache, the specific fonts are also listed with no apparent problems.

Presumably the issue is with the Jupyter's cache or in my temporary environment, but I'm unable to figure out. Any ideas appreciated!

Output:

3

4

\[4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 'a'\]

Question:

 For loop started iterating on range function output which is 0,1,2,3,4 from right to left. The first value of i=0 which is passed to print function and we see  0 is printed above. Then insert function is invoked which says starts populating the list a at index with value of i which is current 0

So we should see after for loop finishes iterating over range (0,1,2,3,4)

\[0,1,2,3,4,""a""\] 

But I see:

\[4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 'a'\]

Last year, I decided I want to learn Python since coding is considered extremely valuable

I have never coded before and have zero programming experience (I’m a Mechanical Engineer). I know this sounds dumb, I don’t even know exactly what motivated me to learn python.

I’ve been learning Python seriously for the past few months and so far, I have finished a few beginner courses with full discipline.

	•	The complete CS50’s Intro to Programming with Python

	•	FreeCodeCamp’s 4-hour YouTube course

	•	Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (completed all 24 Chapters.. it took 2 months)

Even after studying all these Python course for several months and doing practice problems, I still feel like I don’t really get Python. 

I can follow what’s happening in tutorials and each course, but when I try to start a Python project of on my own, I don’t know how to even begin. Specifically, I get stuck on what functions to use, when and how to use loops, when to raise exceptions etc.

I know that the best way to learn is to build projects, and there was also a recent post here that practice is the only way to get better at Python. 

I want to make a habit of writing at least one small program each day.  The problem is that when I pick a project idea, I have no idea how to structure it. I usually ask an LLM to write the code and explain it, but the examples it gives are often too complicated for a beginner.

Can anyone share the best resources or website that would help me learn how to work daily on a Python project and build up from there?

What kind of simple daily Python projects
 or routines would help me get better?

But now when I actually write stuff for clients I find myself constantly asking ""should I try to catch that error? Will it make it better or worse?"" ""Should I write prints with info about how data handling was done, would it even be useful?"" 

I don't wanna bother my superior with every if statement and wanna learn something on my own, so...

and while these functions are not difficult to reason out in pseudocode, such as the mean function likely requiring:

a count variable to keep track of non-empty elements in the dataset

a sum variable to add the integer elements in the dataset

an average variable to be declared as: average = sum/count

I have been hitting wall after wall of syntax errors, and usually after this I just take a step back and try to do python exercise problems, but it is usually reviewing the basics of a data type such as intro to dictionaries, 'make a clock tutorial', and other things that are a bit too.. surface level?

However most data science tutorials simply use the library functions without explaining as well.

Of course I cannot find any tutorial that is an exact 1:1 of my case, but when I'm alone I end up spending more time on practice than my actual assignment until I realize I cannot directly extract anything relevant from it.

I would consider using an LLM but I don't know it's that appropriate if I don't have the knowledge to properly check for errors."

* I’ve labeled a few issues as “good first issue” for newcomers.
* Any help, feedback, or suggestions are very welcome!

I should also mention that I haven’t used GitHub much until now. Lately, I’ve been spending more time coding, so I decided to open up my projects to the world, connect with other developers, and I’m very eager to collaborate and hear any suggestions for improvement.

If you’re interested in contributing or just want to check it out, feel free to fork the repo and open a PR.

Thanks in advance!"

&gt;

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

* Using `pdfplumber` to extract text and split questions using regex patterns (`Q1.`, `Question 1.`, etc.)
* Storing each question with metadata (page number, file name, marks, etc.) in **SQLite**
* Created a **semantic search** pipeline using **MiniLM / Sentence-Transformers** \+ **FAISS** to match topic queries like *“transition metals,” “coordination compounds,” “Fe–EDTA,”* etc.
* I can run manual topic searches, and it returns the correct question blocks perfectly.

Where I’m stuck:

* I want the system to **automatically detect topic-based queries** (like “show electrochemistry questions” or “organic reactions”) and then fetch relevant question text directly from the indexed PDFs or training data, *without me manually triggering the retrieval*.
* The returned output should be **verbatim questions** (not summaries), with the source and page number.
* Essentially, I want a smooth “retrieval-augmented question extractor”, where users just type a topic, and the system instantly returns matching questions.

My current flow looks like this:

    user query → FAISS vector search → return top hits (exact questions) → display results
    

…but I’m not sure how to make this trigger *intelligently* whenever the query is topic-based.

Would love advice on:

* Detecting when a query should trigger the retrieval (keywords, classifier, or a rule-based system?)
* Structuring the retrieval + response pipeline cleanly (RAG-style)
* Any examples of **document-level retrieval systems that return verbatim text/snippets** rather than summaries

I’m using:

* `pdfplumber` for text extraction
* `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for embeddings
* `FAISS` for vector search
* Occasionally **Gemini API** for query understanding or text rephrasing

If anyone has done something similar (especially for educational PDFs or topic-based QA), I’d really appreciate your suggestions or examples 🙏  


**TL;DR:**  
Trying to make my MiniLM + FAISS retrieval system auto-fetch *verbatim topic-based questions* from PDFs like CBSE papers. Extraction + semantic search works; stuck on integrating automatic topic detection and retrieval triggering."

# The Goal

Convert the single-column output of `df['column'].value_counts()` (a **Pandas Series**) into a clean, two-column **Pandas DataFrame** with explicit headers.

# My Code (Failing)

I attempted to use the `inplace=True` argument, expecting the variable `room_counts` to be modified in place.

    # Assume 'df' is a loaded Pandas DataFrame
    room_counts = df[""room_type""].value_counts()

# The Error

    TypeError: Cannot reset_index inplace on a Series to create a DataFrame

# The Question

The documentation for `pandas.Series.reset_index` clearly includes `inplace=True` as a parameter. If it's supported, **why does Pandas explicitly prevent this operation when it results in a structural change from a Series to a DataFrame?** What is the fundamental Pandas rule or design principle I'm overlooking here?"

    def circle_question(ctx: QuestionContext):
        # Generate a radius and find the circumference.
        r = ctx.variable('radius', random.randint(1, 100)/10)
        ctx.output_workings(f'2 x pi x ({ctx.variables[r]})')
        ctx.solution('circumference', math.pi*2*ctx.variables[r])
    
        # Can return a context but it doesn't matter.
        return ctx

And below this is how I search and import the function:

    # question_editor_page.py
    class QuestionEditorPage(tk.Frame):
      ...
      def _get_function(self, module, file_path):
        """"""

        Returns the function or None if zero/multiple flags are found.
        """"""
        # Scan for functions flagged by the decorator
        flagged = [
            fn for _, fn in inspect.getmembers(module, inspect.isfunction)
            if getattr(fn, ""_is_question"", False)
        ]
    
        # No flagged function.
        if not flagged:
            self.controller.log(
                LogLevel.ERROR,
                f""No @question function found in {file_path}""
            )
            return
        # More than one flagged function.
        if len(flagged) &gt; 1:

        return fn

And here is exporting all the question data into a file including the imported function:

    # question_editor_page.py
    class QuestionEditorPage(tk.Frame):
      ...
      def _export_question(self):
        ...
        q = Question(

        year = year,
        month = month
        )
    
        q.export()

Lastly, this is the export method for Question:

    # question.py
    class Question:

I tried 

    life = life - 1

And it just goes into the negatives for wrong answers. 

&gt; you have - 4 lives remaining

&gt; you have - 11 lives remaining

&gt; you have -18 lives remaining

I think I'm losing life for each unmatched letter, not just for each unmatched attempt.

I’m wondering if you have any suggestions on which project structure approach has proven to be the best, or if there’s even a “rule” when it comes to organizing Python folders?

I’d really like to start thinking about my projects—even the simpler ones—as if they were already bigger applications (so that I immediately build a sense of how to set up relationships between different parts of the app).

One thing that confuses me is the use of `src` and `app`. I’ve seen cases where the `main` file (the entry point) is placed inside `app`, while in other cases it’s located directly in the root folder. I’ve also come across `__init__.py` files that are completely empty.

Here are some examples:

    │   └── module1.py

1nwtz8t,Trouble extracting recipe data with python-chefkoch,DaveDarell,6,8,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nwtz8t/trouble_extracting_recipe_data_with_pythonchefkoch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nwtz8t/trouble_extracting_recipe_data_with_pythonchefkoch/,2025-10-03T09:01:08,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on a side project: I want to build a web application for recipe management.  
Originally, I thought about making a native iOS app, but I quickly realized how complicated and restrictive it is to develop and deploy apps on iOS without going through a lot of hurdles. So instead, I want to start with a web app.

The idea:

* Add recipes manually (via text input).
* Import recipes from [chefkoch.de](https://www.chefkoch.de/) automatically.
* Store and manage them in a structured way (ingredients, preparation steps, total time, tags, etc.).

For the import, I found this Python package [https://pypi.org/project/python-chefkoch/2.1.0/](https://pypi.org/project/python-chefkoch/2.1.0/)

But when I try to use it, I run into an error.  
Here’s my minimal example:

`from chefkoch.recipe import Recipe`

`recipe = Recipe('https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/1069361212490339/Haehnchen-Ananas-Curry-mit-Reis.html')`

`print(recipe.total_time)`

And this is the traceback:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""C:\Users\xxx\Documents\Programmieren\xxx\github.py"", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
        print(recipe.total_time)
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ""C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\functools.py"", line 1026, in __get__
        val = self.func(instance)
      File ""C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages\chefkoch\recipe.py"", line 193, in total_time
        time_str = self.__info_dict[""totalTime""]
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    KeyError: 'totalTime'

It looks like the `totalTime` key is missing from the recipe’s info dictionary. Maybe the site changed their structure since the package was last updated?

My goal is to extract:

* preparation time,
* cooking time,
* total time,
* ingredients,
* instructions,
* maybe also tags/keywords.

Has anyone worked with this library recently or knows a better way to parse recipes from Chefkoch?  
Should I instead scrape the site myself (e.g. with BeautifulSoup) or is there a more up-to-date package that I missed?

As I'm a newbie, any advice would be appreciated"

I started in march and am just now getting in to my major classes with the first one I’m having difficulty with being “Intro to Programming” which is basically an intro to Python class. I’ve never felt so dumb in my entire existence. I understand that I’m learning something completely from scratch and I have no background knowledge on the subject. On top on this being my first time going to school online and basically having to teach myself without the help of a teacher present, I’m 29 and haven’t been in school since high school over a decade ago. So I feel like it goes without saying that it’s been rough. I’ve been trying to go thru everything step by step trying not to miss anything because I understand that the more I absorb from this the better trajectory my career will be on. With that said I’m falling behind in this class trying to take notes and actually understand everything. Even worse, it’s like I can answer the questions and get the labs and activities correct but Im waiting for the feeling that I get when learning anything else that it’s all coming together and I’m not just regurgitating information to answer a question but actually UNDERSTANDING and getting it. My wife who is a college grad is telling me that I’m doing college wrong. She says turn in the work first for a grade, go back and absorb the info later. I don’t want to come off as a whiner and woe is me because I know anything worth wanting is gonna take hard work to achieve but I guess I’m just wondering is this feeling normal in the beginning? Does it get better later?"

What I do:  
I compile a Python app with PyInstaller. Before packaging I obfuscate the payload; at a high level the layers are: LZMA compression, XOR encoding, a ROT-style shift, and a final hex + XOR step.

What I want help with:  
• Why might this trigger unwantedx detections even though the program is legitimate?  
• What concrete, PyInstaller-friendly build changes, flags, or packaging practices should I try first to reduce false positives? I’m interested in normal build options and hygiene (for example: onedir vs onefile, build flags, including metadata, signing, reproducible builds, etc.).  
• How can I change my obfuscation to not trigger av flags?

What Im not asking for  
I’m not looking for “switch packer” answers. I also don’t want advice that simply says “stop obfuscating” without any constructive alternatives.

I’m working with PDFs exported from Illustrator that include bleed (abundance). By default, PyMuPDF (fitz) seems to use the MediaBox, which means when I scale a page it also considers the bleed area.

What I actually need is to resize only the trim size (final cut size, without bleed) so the exported PDF is exactly “al vivo.” Ideally, if the TrimBox exists, I’d like to use that; otherwise, fall back to MediaBox.

Here’s a simplified version of my current approach:

doc = fitz.open(""input.pdf"")
for page in doc:
    orig_rect = page.rect  # &lt;-- this includes bleed
    # I want to use the TrimBox instead
    # resize page here...

Important: I want to do this without rasterizing the content — if the PDF contains vectors, they should remain vectors after scaling.

👉 Question: Is there a recommended way to achieve this with PyMuPDF, or should I look into another Python PDF library better suited for handling TrimBox and vector-preserving scaling?

Thanks!

I’m trying to create a simple Telegram bot in Python, but my internet is restricted in my country, so I need to use a SOCKS5 proxy (for example via Tor or Nekoray) to connect.

I’ve seen that python-telegram-bot[socks] installs httpx[socks], and I understand the difference between socks5:// and socks5h://.

However, I haven’t found a complete working example online. Most tutorials either:

Don’t use a proxy at all, or

Only show code snippets without a working bot implementation.


My questions:

1. Can anyone share a working example of a Python Telegram bot using a SOCKS5 proxy?


2. Any tips on using socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 with Tor/Nekoray for this purpose?



I’m looking for something that works out-of-the-box, so I can learn from it.

Thanks a lot!

I am trying to automate some testing I am doing on a mass amount of motors. I have a few years of experience using PyTest so I want to use that to automate the testing procedures.

The tests are being validated using data from the motor when driven such as:

Thermocouple values (some analog val)

Limit switch values (0/1)

Motor position feedback (angle in degrees)

Force feedback (analog val)

Some commands the script may test:

Motor direction change

Motor freq set

Motor voltage set

Basic motor movement commands etc.

What would be the best way to go about creating a separate script/emulator for my PyTest script to pull values from without testing on the actual hardware? Something that could ideally continuously update and take in commands and output tlm potentially.

For context, I'm a math major learning python under the computer science department. I would really like to pass this class because it's my second time taking it and my research interest relies on coding and machine-learning so it's imperative I get through this..

Our labs are very similar to competitive programming. If not similar, then it is exactly like competitive programming. In a span of a few hours, we are required to solve multiple problems through python coding. Solving all of the different cases for one problem means full points.

I really would like to start scoring better on them, and hopefully so much more better for our exams. I do wanna look at python in a different, maybe more affectionate light, and not as something I dread everytime I enter the labs. 

So, here is the question: what websites can be a good starter for someone like me (With incredibly minimal knowledge on Python) can learn competitive programming? I've heard of AtCoder but the website is still too overstimulating for me so I have difficulties. Much of the problems I face are understanding recursion and comprehension so if there are any tips, I'd be grateful to have them! I have a very wonky foundation for python courtesy of a very fast-paced curriculum.

I’m completely new to this but I’m happy to learn some coding if that’s the best way forward. A few questions: •	Is there a way to use eBay’s API (or another method) to automatically pull the “sold” prices for a list of items? •	If so, what language/tool would be best to start with? (I was thinking Python since it seems beginner-friendly.) •	Are there any libraries or example projects that would make this easier for someone with no coding experience yet?

End goal: I’d love to automate checking my Excel list against eBay’s sold listings instead of manually searching each one.

I have a task to create a relatively simple SVG (or better said the XML code for it) based on some CSV data input.

The CSV would consist of 24 lines, each with 12 comma-separated variables. And based on the variables in each line I would generate 24 ever-smaller dodecahedrons with varying colors for the 12 individual segments. Creating the actual graphic elements is easy as I can pre-generate all that in Inkscape and use the file's XML code as a text template. The only thing I need is to manipulate the relevant parts of the XML.

As I am a Python noob (wanna-be-better-but-not-having-time) I know a small bit about Python already, but I would need some Tutorials to study to learn how to handle the CSV input into variables and then assembling the text of the SVG from pre-made XML text blocks and the added variables inbetween (by mainly using some nested IF statements/Match/Case syntax to vary the output based on input data).

Can you recommend Tutorials on this? I believe the standard Python libraries can handle input and text output manipulation (i.e. I do not need Pandas and the like)?"

The part of automation itself is quite easy, and is 100% working. 
There is only a problem: the page in which the automation takes places is ""locked"" behind a login.
 
The flow is this: if I try to reach the URL that I need, I get redirected to the login URL. If I login there (name, password, login button) I get redirected in a Homepage. From this page now I can reach the original URL, because now I'm logged in. 

I automated all this process as well, the login info, and is working, but the only problem is thst for safety reason I don't want to store the password anywhere, so for now I put a prompt that ask the password and insert it (I don't even know if this is a safe method in first place...). 

So basically I would like to avoid to type the password everytime, also for security reason. 
What I would like to do is to login manually and then keep a chrome instance opened where selenium act. Conceptually seems very simple but I had a lot of problems, maybe due to the security enforcement of the PC I'm working on. 

These 2 solutions were given by Gemini IA and both of them don't work. 

The first solution is to load chrome option with default profile. This doesn't work because for security reason is not possible to load the default profile. Also if I close and reopen the browser I have to login again on the website I'm visiting, but I can only load a option when is not used, so these two concept collids.

The second solution seems more reasonable. Gemini suggested to manually lunch Chrome (form command line) with debug option in a certain port. Then reach the website and manually login.Then, without closing the browser, use again chrome option to ""link"" the application to that port. In this way no new instance of Chrome will be created but, in theory, it will use the already open window.

Unfortunately this solution doesn't work for me, and I think is because some enforcement from company PC: even before the Pyrhok command, if I launch from command line chrome with debugger and then try to listen to that port with another browser (Firefox) I'm not able to. 
I went trough a lot of debugging suggested by Gemini, nothing worked. 

Do you have any suggestions for this specifics use case? "

1num82y,How would I loop and create a yes/no conditional loop,tia_Tameras_triplet,0,19,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1num82y/how_would_i_loop_and_create_a_yesno_conditional/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1num82y/how_would_i_loop_and_create_a_yesno_conditional/,2025-09-30T19:11:19,"Hi! I'm making a grade converter which is the code attached above. The whole point of my project is to figure out how to make (I think they're called) while loops. With that said, I'm confused on how to make a conditional statement saying ""Continue? Y/N"" with Y or yes continuing the program from the users input and N or no would ""break"" the code. My confusion is WHERE I would put the \*while TRUE loop. Does it go BEFORE my main code and THEN I put the yes no question. Furthermore, would my ""Continue y/n"" question be coded as a boolean? If someone can show me how this should look when integrated with the CURRENT code, I would be so thankful, bc Khan Academy is confusing me...

(PS This isn't for a grade or class assignment, but to learn how this loop stuff works)

  
print(""Letter Grade Converter"")

grade = int(input(""Enter your grade ""))

if grade &gt;= 88:

print(""Your letter grade is an A"")

elif grade &gt;= 80:

print(""Your letter grade is a B"")

elif grade &gt;= 67:

print(""Your grade is a C"")

elif grade &gt;= 60:

print(""Your grade is a D"")

elif grade &lt; 60:

print (""Your grade is an F"")"
1nu7lux,Suggestions on my Learning Tree,Sad-Emu-5783,8,10,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nu7lux/suggestions_on_my_learning_tree/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nu7lux/suggestions_on_my_learning_tree/,2025-09-30T08:21:42,"So I've just recently started learning Python seriously, and here's a list of things I've managed to complete:

\- Lists, Loops  
\- Some Basic functions like `.join(), .isalnum(), .isalpha(), .isdigit(), .replace(), type(), .lower(), .upper()`  
\- Some Basic Dictionary things like `collections.Counter` or `collections.defaultdict`  
\- Basic String Slicing and Loops inside Strings, Concatenation  
\- Generator Statements, also inside `print()`  
\- Some Other Dictionary things like `Dictionary Sorting (by keys AND values), Recursive sorting, Nested defaultdicts, Loops inside Dictionaries`   
\- Working with .txt files like `with open(""file.txt"")` and opening them in different modes like ""r"", ""w"" or ""a"" and removing whitespaces using `.strip()`  
\- Working with .csv files using `csv.reader(), csv.writer(), csv.DictReader(), csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames = [])` and how to use the `csv.reader() object` as a global variable.  
\- Some Basic CSV Functions like `.writerow(), .writerows(), .writeheader()`  
\- Some other stuff like `next(), iter(), break, continue, pass`

Now I'd like to know, what should I learn next?  
I asked ChatGPT, and it generated the following Learning Tree for me:

# 1. Finish Advanced Dictionary Concepts

* **Shallow vs Deep Copy:** Understand how changes to nested dicts propagate when copying

# 2. Real-World CSV Mastery

🔶 Learn CSV in the wild:

* Handling dirty data: missing values, malformed rows, blank fields
* `csv.Sniffer` – detects delimiter, quote character, etc.
* Handling custom delimiters: `delimiter="";""` or `\t`
* Quoting logic: `quotechar`, `quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`, etc.
* File encodings: `utf-8`, `utf-16`, `ISO-8859-1`, `cp1252`

# 🔶 Build error-tolerant parsers:

* Use `try`/`except` blocks to skip bad rows
* Logging invalid rows for review

# 3. JSON (and Dict ↔ JSON Conversion)

You should learn:

* `json.load()`, `json.dump()`
* `json.loads()` for string parsing
* Pretty-printing JSON with `indent=4`
* Writing JSON safely with `ensure_ascii=False`

Once you're comfortable:

* Build converters: CSV ↔ JSON
* Fetch JSON from web APIs (later when you learn `requests`)

# 4. Pandas for CSV &amp; JSON

You’ll learn:

* `pd.read_csv()`, `df.to_csv()`
* `df.to_json()` and `pd.read_json()`
* Built-in error handling and NA value management
* Handling large CSVs and Excel files

# 5. (Optional but Helpful) – File I/O Extras

These are not “required” but will **elevate** your I/O mastery:

# 🔸 Binary files

# 🔸 Working with file paths

# 🔸 Logging instead of print

# 🔸 Writing CLI tools

Once you finish this, you’re ready to move into:

|Next Big Skill|Why it’s relevant|
|:-|:-|
|`requests`📡  |Pull real JSON data from APIs (weather, finance, etc.)|
|🐍 OOP|Clean up file-processing code using classes|
|🧪 Unit Testing|Test your file-processing scripts|
|🧰 Data Cleaning Tools|`openpyxltabulatexlrd`Learn  ,  ,  , etc.|
|📊 Data Visualisation|`matplotlibseabornpandas.plot()`Plot cleaned data using  ,  , or  |

  
What do you guys suggest? Any changes in the Learning Path ChatGPT generated for me?"

Broadly speaking, this application's project file is a collection of JSON files that each consist of a list of dicts. Some of those JSON files have relationships to other JSON files using UUIDs to form it into what is ultimately a fairly messy relational database. 

My current approach to this process has consisted largely of iterating over lists (and recently I cleaned it up to put list comprehensions in it). Some of these data tables end up in pandas, which is reasonably helpful for some of them, although it gets hairy when several of the objects I'm dealing with are nested dicts, especially when brringing in related data from other tables). I also need to be sure that referencing and manipulating data is happening on the canonical data set that gets exported, rather than on copies of that data which I would then have to worry about merging bak into the original data set prior to serializing and export, so I think I also need a bit of clarification on when data is passed as pointers or as copies of the data. 

As part of rearchitecting my tools (which were really just ugly hammers), I've built a library of classes for each of the JSON files with defined data structures and methods to import those JSON files into python objects (and serialize/export them back out to JSON in such a way that the original application can still read them without throwing up). I'm fairly new to python classes, and with the help of Copilot  giving me the general structure and saving a bunch of typing and debugging (and a whole lot of massaging of the generated code to make it work the way I wanted it to), I have got a number of functions built to work with those objects, and that's all working great. 

However... 

I recently learned about the existence of models, but I'm still not quite grokking how they work, and now I am wondering if that may be a better approach to these data objects, and whether that will ultimately simplify handling this data, in which case I'd rather . I'd like to be able to load the whole thing into python, relationships and all, so that I can work with it as a proper database (including with threaded functions that can manipulate individual objects in the lists independently of other processes, and still be able to export the modified list), but I'm not really sure what the best python approach to doing this would be, or even what questions I should be asking. 

So, if anyone can help educate this n00b who is not a software dev, it would be much appreciated.

# Activity 3 - Acreage Manager

# Goal

The goal of this program is to create a simple Acreage Manager. The program is tasked with asking for the size of a large piece of land, measured in acres. Once obtained, the program will ask for 5 different plot sizes and finally the program will determine how many plots of each size can be obtained from the original piece of land and if any acres are left over, **assuming** **we try to obtain as many of the large plot sizes as possible first.**

1. Create a new python program and save it with the following format
   1. ***LastNameFirstInitial\_AcreageManager.py***
2. Next, it should ask for the user’s name, which should be entered in the following format: The program should then display “**Welcome** ***Name!”***, where ***Name*** is the user’s entered value.

1. Next, the program should ask the user to enter the total acreage of the land they wish to split up. This number will be a whole number.

1. Due to maintenance and storage issues, a “small” percentage of the original land must be left unsold. This percentage should be randomly generated by your program and should fall within an inclusive range from 5% to 15%. Once calculated, the percentage and left over land should be displayed to the user. **Note:** *If the calculated percentage of unusable land is not a whole number, the program should* ***round up*** ***to the next acre***.
   1. **Note:** Make sure to show the percentage itself (e.g. 13%), its decimal value of acreage (e.g. 13.375), and its adjusted total (e.g. 14).

1. Next, the program should ask the user to enter **five** nonzero, positive whole number values that represent the different plot sizes. The user must enter the values in decreasing order (largest to smallest) and there cannot be duplicate values.

1. Once all five values have been entered, calculate how many of each plot type can be created from the usable land. 
   1. The program should attempt to generate plots of the largest sizes first, and only when there is not enough space, move on to the next size. This essentially generates the fewest plots possible.
   2. Note: In the example of 120 acres, and the above plot sizes (28, 8, 5, 3, 2) these are the results: four 28’s, one 8, zero 5s, 3s, and 2s.
2. Display the number of each plot size that will be generated. 
   1. **Note:** Make sure to display any left over acres that could not be used to create a plot of land.

1. Thank the user for using your program and end.

Notes:

* If you are unsure about how to do something or unable to complete it, comment on your code. Comments clarify your intentions even if the goal is not reached.
* **DO NOT use conditional statements or loops**. No conditional statements are necessary to complete any portion of this assignment. Even if you know control structures that could make things easier because of past experiences, do not use them. Write your code as cleanly as possible *without* them.

My code:

    #part 2
    name = input(""Welcome to Holton-Atms Acreage Manager, "" \
    "" what is your name?: "")
    print()
    print (""Welcome"", name, "", things are about to get crazy!"")
    #part 3
    import math
    import random
    acreage_num_string = input(""How much acreage would you like to parcel out today?: "")
    #part 4
    acreage_percent_string = random.randint(5, 15)
    acreage_unsold = (int(acreage_percent_string))

1nuaai9,"[Project] Open-source stock screener: LLM reads 10-Ks, fixes EV, does SOTP, and outputs BUY/SELL/UNCERTAIN",ievkz,2,1,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nuaai9/project_opensource_stock_screener_llm_reads_10ks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nuaai9/project_opensource_stock_screener_llm_reads_10ks/,2025-09-30T11:10:20,"**TL;DR**: I open-sourced a CLI that mixes classic fundamentals with LLM-assisted 10-K parsing. It pulls Yahoo data, adjusts EV by debt-like items found in the 10-K, values insurers by ""float,"" does SOTP from operating segments, and votes **BUY/SELL/UNCERTAIN** via quartiles across peer groups.

**What it does**

* Fetches core metrics (Forward P/E, P/FCF, EV/EBITDA; EV sanity-checked or recomputed).
* Parses the latest 10-K (edgartools + LLM) to extract **debt-like** adjustments (e.g., leases) -&gt; **fair-value EV**.
* **Insurance only**: extracts **float** (unpaid losses, unearned premiums, etc.) and compares **Float/EV** vs sub-sector peers.
* **SOTP**: builds a segment table (ASC 280), maps segments to peer buckets, applies median EV/EBIT (fallback: EV/EBITDA×1.25, EV/S≈1 for loss-makers), sums implied EV -&gt; premium/discount.
* Votes per metric -&gt; per group -&gt; overall **BUY/SELL/UNCERTAIN**.

**Example run**

```bash
pip install ai-asset-screener
ai-asset-screener --ticker=ADBE --group=BIG_TECH_CORE --use-cache

If a ticker is in one group only, you can omit `--group`.

I discover or create an exception which then requires code further up to have to be able to handle it. 

New features being built into the prior structure make further features even more infeasible (for me). The original structure becomes diluted from the modifications and then it becomes more difficult to debug or easily identify where something is happening. It becomes more delicate.

I was thinking strict directory rules and modular scripts would help but I couldn’t quite stick to my own plan. 

Any tips on how to handle this? The problem is not necessarily specific only to Python, but more of “how to structure code without knowing the final structure in advance”.

I am working on an API using FastAPI, Pytest, and aio\_pika. I am trying to implement everything asynchronously, but I've reached a point where I solved an issue without fully understanding why. I am using a connection Pool with aio\_pika and using a singleton to manage it. If I run only one test using the channel pool, it works; however, the second one hangs indefinitely. A funny thing is that between tests, pytest uses the same singleton instance, but it looks like it closes the event loop. So my singleton says that the channel pool is open, but the channel itself is closed. Why is that? What is the interaction between the runtime and the event loop? I solved it by cleaning the instances of my singleton in a fixture. Here is some of the code.

Also, if you guys have an article or book about the event loop in Python I would appreciate.

Solution:

      @pytest_asyncio.fixture(scope=""function"")
    async def rabbitmq_connection():
    
        yield await aio_pika.connect_robust(settings.broker_url.get_secret_value())
    
        # NOTE: Needs to do this for clearing the singleton instance in tests, or the pool returns a closed channel but a open pool
        from infrastructure.message_broker import MessageBroker
    
        MessageBroker._instances = {}
    
        connection = await aio_pika.connect_robust(settings.broker_url.get_secret_value())
        async with connection:
            channel = await connection.channel()
            async with channel:
                await channel.queue_delete(settings.artists_album_queue)

Singleton Implementation:

    class SingletonABCMeta(ABCMeta, type):
        _instances = {}
    
        def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                cls._instances[cls] = super(SingletonABCMeta, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            return cls._instances[cls]

Broker Connection Handler:

     class MessageBroker(IMessageBroker):
        def __init__(
            self, broker_url: str, max_conn_size: int = 2, max_channel_size: int = 10
        ):
            self._broker_url = broker_url

            self._channel_pool: Pool[AbstractChannel] | None = None
    
        async def _get_connection(self) -&gt; AbstractRobustConnection:
            return await aio_pika.connect_robust(self._broker_url)

                )
            return self._connection_pool
    
        async def _get_channel(self) -&gt; AbstractChannel:

I am a teacher, and I hate assigning seats. It always takes me forever, and it the end, I often end up with one kid who I just couldn't make happy. I'd like to write a program where I can download a csv from Google Forms. In the form, the kids can add a list of five preferred partners. The program would then make groups in which everyone has a preferred partner. Also, it'd be great if I could add avoided pairings and maybe even priority seating.

I've done some initial messing around and have managed to implement a make\_groups function that will give me five groups. However, it doesn't always place everyone. I can keep running it until I get a combination where everyone gets placed, but how might I loop it until the unassigned list is empty? Even better, until there are also at least three students in a group? I've tried using a ""while True"" type of set up but can't seem to figure it out.

I normally code in MATLAB because, tbh, I am a spaghetti coder and it's much easier not to completely fuck up my environments and variables there (and also because most of what I do is image processing/analyzing big datasets). I need to write a script for serial command processing, though, and that seems to be much easier to do in Python.

That's where I'm running into problems.

I'm trying to use PyCharm and a virtual environment using conda, but I cannot for the life of me set the correct path where my packages I installed using pip install are. I tried everything I could think of and simply cannot find the pyserial package on PyCharm even though I \*know\* it's on my computer--I just cannot add the correct Python interpreter in settings because PyCharm does not seem to see it.

Over the years I've done a number of weird things with Python, exactly zero of which are best practices. I have Python and associated packages in a number of different locations, such as, but not limited to C:\\Users\\My Name\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11\_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python311\\Scripts , C:\\Users\\My Name\\AppData\\Local\\pip, C:\\Users\\My Name\\AppData\\Local\\conda\\conda , C:\\Users\\My Name\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11\_qbz5n2kfra8p0,   C:\\Users\\My Name (this is where I have some weird looking .jupyter, .anaconda, .ipython etc folders, idk what they do). This is just based on my PATH variable, idek where else Python could be on my computer. (Yes there is a space in my username because I set this computer up ages ago and didn't anticipate coding on this computer, yes I know etc.)

I've read [https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/uninstall](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/uninstall) but I'm not sure that would address all of my problems--I'm worried I might need to uninstall and reinstall Python itself which might fuck up any number of things and which I really don't want to try to do by myself. Help? (Or, alternatively, am I beyond help/going to have to set up an entire new virtual machine to do this?)"

First time posting here - hope the tongue in cheek title passes.

Since becoming fascinated by AI, I've been exploring a *lot* of Python ... stuff.

Naturally ... package management and environments come up a lot.

I've been using Linux for many years, but I think the ""approaches"" are fairly common across OSes:

I try to avoid installing anything onto the system python. I have dabbled in Conda (and Poetry) but mostly find that they're overkill for my uses: typically scripting everything and anything relating to data cleanup and working with AI agents.

I am a big fan of uv. But I'm also old school enough to worry that repetitively installing big packages like transformers will eat up all my storage (I have 4TB so probably shouldn't worry!).

As it's easier to explain a typical use by example: I'm updating my website and am trying to write a couple of scraping scripts to pull in some links from old author pages. This is a once time project but ... I always like to give projects their own repo and ... space. Do this a few times per day and you end up with an awful lot of repos and virtual environments!

I don't object to creating virtual environments per se. But I do feel like if I'm using a fairly narrow list of packages that it would be *way* more efficient to just have one or two that are almost always activated.

I'm just not quite sure what's the best way to do that! Conda seems heavyweight. Pyenv seems more intended for creating versions based around specific versions. And pipx .... I mostly fall back to when I know I'll need something a lot (say openai) and might use it outside the context of project environments/repos.

For folks who tend to work on lots of little repos rather than a few major projects with very tightly defined requirements .... what do you guys do to avoid wasting way too much time activating, deactivating venvs and ... doing it all over again.

There are bash aliases of course but .. I'm sure I'm doing it wrong / there's a better way.

TIA!"

I have a fresh installation of Debian, and in the past I was using Ubuntu. 

I was using Anaconda, and I was always installing packages with 'pip' command. Never used a 'conda' command. By using Anaconda, I had a python installation that was not interfering with the system's, so I was avoiding any potential problems.

There is a lot of buzz around 'UV' package manager, and I was wondering, if you want to have a python separate of the system's can UV handle that? 

For the time being I have installed miniconda that's less bloated. Should I keep using that and on top use UV to install packages and make any venvs when needed? 

My goal is to make sure I don't mess with the system's Python and keep it clean. 

Do I need conda for that, or UV alone can handle it? 

Any help is much appreciated, because I am a bit confused with all the package managers.   
My understanding is that conda will handle any system libraries required, whereas uv/pip can handle the python packages (and create easily venvs with UV) 

  
Thank you very much!

Of course, they do mention that their examples are based on a `Screen` object called `screen` (and they are), etc, but it's still strange to me to see `turtle.title`. Is the ""turtle"" prefix before the dot just designating that the `title` method belongs to the whole turtle library, even though you'd really need an object of a certain type to invoke it upon? Would we ever actually invoke a method like this without such an object, as in literally `turtle.title()`? Am I just being silly? :)"

I have finished CS50 Python course and actually the basic CS course, as well as another Python course.

I wonder what to do now? I have basics and I need to improve these skills, but I think it will be better to learn something else and improve on the way. I know that I need to work on the projects and build my portfolio, but what direction should I take and which libraries, languages or frameworks should I learn to have good portfolio? 

  
When I see vacancies most of them ask for 1 year experience, but a lot of other things including python. "

My questions are: is that course worth it (have you done it ?) ? do you recommend some other content on this more advanced python ""more low-level oriented"" optimizations ?

For context, I'm a semi-senior going senior python developer (backend, MLOps, ML, GenAI, etc.), and I am very confident in my architecture and design skills. I also believe I have quite advanced python knowledge (at least comparing me to peers and when looking at certificates' curriculums), though clearly I don't know everything about Python (otherwise I would already know how to optimize it). I also have good knowledge of concurrency, paralellism, and python's mechanisms and libraries that deal with those.

My intention with this is to be able to provide slightly faster applications to my clients, since GenAI and ML solutions are usually not as fast as clients desire; I'm not looking into any magical solutions nor N times faster performance, just to be able to gain that small % of optimization (I would also love to be able to tackle more performance-critical applications in my future, though Python would probably not be the best language for those)."

Let's say I have a deeply nested function call with a lot of arguments, which I need to split over 2 lines.  
Should I do a single additional ident, or do I align with the opening parenthesis?

    vs.

II. I have a long logging message - an _f-string_. What's the preferred way of splitting it?  
(I'm leaning towards the last one and I don't want to use `""""""`)

    # plus operator - end of the line
    log.error(f""An error occured at {aaa} when doing {bbb}"" +

    # backslash
    log.error(f""An error occured at {aaa} when doing {bbb}"" \
        "" in the context of {ccc} on server {ddd}"")

    # auto-string concatenation when strings are inside parentheses
    log.error(f""An error occured at {aaa} when doing {bbb}""
        "" in the context of {ccc} on server {ddd}"")


III. Finally, a long `# end-of-line comment` (the actual code is well within the 80/120 character limit).  
Should I leave it as it is? Place it before? Place it after?

I come looking for guidance. I've been a python developer / data analyst for 3 years. I work on a (small, 20 ppl) company but I'm the only developer. I've created a SQL Server database, scrapers, BI reports and scripts (in a VM) that automate many of the company processes (currently looking to get into SAP SDK). The thing is, I feel I could do so much better. Since I don't have any seniors to teach me, I feel I've been doing all of these without following good programming and security practices.   
  
For example, in the VM, I run all my daily automation scripts with Task Scheduler and .bats (last week I learned I should encapsulate these scripts). I don't know if my projects follow the best structure or if they are modular enough, etc. Although everything works and there's no complaints by the company, I know what I'm doing is not good enough and could learn so much more (and do things the ""correct"" way).  
  
What do you guys would recommend me I should focus on learning? Any books, courses or even bootcamps you recommend? What can I do differently? Although I don't feel like a junior anymore, I definetely feel there's so much I should learn before even considering calling myself a senior.

Say, for example, you have an object that can close (like a safe) that allows access to multiple people in a family and work environment. One person (the owner) can access it anytime, but others can only access it once, with a pin code, and directly after opening, the pin code should expire. What would be necessary to create this automation capability for pin code access to be renewed every time someone wants access (that isn't like extremely time-sensitive authentication codes like Google uses - the code should be applicable for about 24 hours)? Would an app be required for something like this?

I need help writing a Python script that works with .tif images (CMYK, without changing color space or resolution).

Here's what the script should do:
	1. Loaded a .tif file from a specific folder.

	2. Ask myself how many vertical bands I want to divide the image into (e.g. if I write 4 → the image is divided into 4 equal vertical bands, maintaining the same height).

	3. A white rectangle 1.5 cm high and as wide as the band must be added to the base of each band.

	4. Inside the rectangle, 5 mm from the left edge, the text must be inserted in the format: file name without extension - Wall C(n)
where n is the band number.
5mm from the right there is a logo

	5. Export the final result into a single PDF file.

Requirements:
	• The CMYK color space of the .tif must not be changed.
	• The resolution must not change.

Additional Information:
	• I have Python installed.
	• I have already installed the Pillow library.

Could someone help me write this script (also using Pillow, ReportLab or other libraries)?

Thank you so much 🙏"

I was planning to have all of `""this string"" second` as a bitbucket repository variable. Is this common/good practice? 

I was also planning to add in all of my secrets like database username, password, server names, etc all added as repository variables. Is that good to do? I'd prefer to avoid including a `.env` file.

1nqv5wl,Need Help To Deploy To AWS Lambda,jakobnunnendorf,0,0,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nqv5wl/need_help_to_deploy_to_aws_lambda/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nqv5wl/need_help_to_deploy_to_aws_lambda/,2025-09-26T07:40:21,"Hello all, I need someone with experience in CI/CD workflows from python to AWS lambda to help me with some issues I encountered!

I am developing a Telegram bot in python running on AWS lambda and have the following project structure:  
  
`- package A`  
`| -- dependency 1`  
`| -- dependency 2`  
`| -- dependency 3`  
`- package B`  
`| -- telegram_bot.py`  
`- package C`  
`| -- dependency 4`  
`| -- dependency 5`  
`| -- dependency 6`  


**First issue I encountered (solved): External Dependencies**  
I solved this by recursively copying the lib directory of my python environment into a python/lib/python3.13/ directory, zipping it, uploading it to aws layers and attaching the layer to the aws layer function.  


**Second issue (bad quick fix found): Internal Dependencies**  
I didn't know how to handle internal dependencies i.e. package B importing functions from package A and package C. I used a quick fix by just copy and pasting all the dependencies into the original lambda\_function.py script that is found when originally creating the lambda function on aws.  
This way, the script didn't have to import any functions from other files at all and it worked well.

**Third issue: CI/CD (in progress...)**

Obviously the aforementioned quick fix is not a longterm solution as it is very inconvenient and error prone. What I would like to do is set up a CI/CD workflow (maybe via Github actions unless you have better suggestions) that triggers on pushing to the main branch and automatically deploys the telegram bot to AWS lambda. For this to work, I probably need to solve the second issue first since I solved it manually before. Then I need to automate the deployment step.

Can someone be so super cool to help me please?"
1nqmudr,[Advanced Typing] Is it possible to dynamically generate type hints based on another argument?,ColdPorridge,2,7,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nqmudr/advanced_typing_is_it_possible_to_dynamically/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1nqmudr/advanced_typing_is_it_possible_to_dynamically/,2025-09-26T00:08:07,"Let's say I have an object, and it takes some args that represent some function, and the arguments that will be passed to that function when it is (at a later time) run:

    def my_func(arg1: int, arg2: str):

    MyObject(
        func=my_func

            arg1: 1,
            arg2: ""a""
        }
    )

Is it possible to use python's typing system to automatically infer what args should be present in func\_args? I used a dict in the example but if something slightly more structured like a tuple or something would make more sense we could consider that. 

And a separate question: if you wanted to do something similar with an emphasis on a nice dev ex, how might you approach this? Note that not all func arguments will be provided at initialization time. I understand there is likely some approach here with curried functions, but I can't really see a method right now that would abstract that away from users in a way that doesn't require them to digest what currying is."

Are there any recommendations for similar packages in the Python ecosystem, or recommendations for the best design to roll it myself?

* The reason why I like topic-based logging is because it's highly configurable -- you can easily toggle logging for whichever part of the app has your issue, and otherwise it's a no-op.
* The inbuilt logging library seems a little too heavyweight and doesn't support the pattern I want.
* I would really like to be able to configure logging through an env var, because I've recently been using them heavily and would like to inject most configuration / secrets through env vars instead of worrying about the configuration / secret override dance."

Oop, me again.

I'm so close I know I almost have it. I'm trying to insert data into a SQL using a function. What it needs to look like is this:

I have my table\_name with 13 columns so the cursor function would need to look like

""INSERT INTO table\_name (column1, column2, column3,...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)""

The problem I'm running into is because I have to make the ? char a string value, when the cursor tries to read it, it produces either the 1 value for 13 columns error is I have ({bloops}), or 0 bindings for 13 values if i take of the parenthesis {bloops}

Essentially, how do I remove the """" around the ? in my tuple without getting a syntax error?"
