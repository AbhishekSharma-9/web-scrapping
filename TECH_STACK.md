# Financial Data Scraping: Tech Stack & Best Practices

This document outlines the standardized technology stack, project structure, and best practices for the "Web Scraping Collection" repository. Adhering to these guidelines ensures our scrapers are robust, maintainable, ethical, and scalable, especially for handling financial data.

## Core Technology Stack üíª

To tackle a variety of scraping challenges, from static pages to dynamic, JavaScript-heavy sites, we will use a combination of powerful libraries.

| Technology                     | Primary Use Case                                           | When to Use                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`requests`**         | Making HTTP requests to fetch static HTML content.         | For simple, fast scraping of websites that don't rely on JavaScript to load content.                             |
| **`BeautifulSoup4`**   | Parsing HTML and XML to extract data.                      | The primary tool for parsing content fetched by `requests`or `Selenium`.                                     |
| **`Selenium`**         | Automating a web browser to interact with dynamic content. | When data is loaded via JavaScript, or you need to simulate user actions like clicking buttons or filling forms. |
| **`Scrapy`**           | A full-fledged scraping framework.                         | For large-scale, complex projects requiring asynchronous requests, built-in pipelines, and advanced features.    |
| **`Pandas`&`NumPy`** | Data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.                 | For processing extracted data, performing calculations, and preparing it for storage.                            |

## Data Storage Strategy üóÑÔ∏è

Choosing the right storage is crucial for data integrity and accessibility.

* **CSV** : Ideal for simple, tabular data that fits a clear row-and-column structure. Use it as the default for basic scrapers.
* **JSON** : Best for nested or semi-structured data, such as API responses or complex object hierarchies.
* **SQLite** : A lightweight, file-based database perfect for local development, testing, and projects that require relational data storage without a full database server.
* **PostgreSQL** : The preferred choice for production environments. It's a powerful, open-source relational database that can handle large volumes of data and concurrent access.

## Implementation Guidelines & Best Practices ‚úÖ

All new and updated scrapers **must** follow these guidelines to ensure quality and consistency.

### 1. Ethical Scraping

Respecting website owners is our top priority.

* **Check `robots.txt`** : Before scraping any site, review its `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://example.com/robots.txt`) to understand which parts of the site you are allowed to access.
* **Rate Limiting** : Never hit a server with rapid-fire requests. Introduce delays to mimic human behavior.
  **Python**

```
  import time

  # Simple delay
  time.sleep(2) # Wait 2 seconds between requests
```

* **User-Agent Rotation** : Identify your bot by setting a proper User-Agent. Rotating User-Agents can help avoid blocks on larger scrapes.
  **Python**

```
  import requests

  headers = {
      'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
  }

  response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

### 2. Error Handling & Retries

Network requests can fail. Your code should be resilient enough to handle it.

* **Use `try...except` Blocks** : Wrap your requests in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions like `requests.exceptions.RequestException`.
* **Implement a Retry Mechanism** : For transient errors (like a temporary network issue), automatically retry the request a few times.
  **Python**

```
  import requests
  import time

  def get_with_retries(url, headers, retries=3, delay=5):
      for i in range(retries):
          try:
              response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
              response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx or 5xx)
              return response
          except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
              print(f"Attempt {i+1} failed: {e}")
              time.sleep(delay)
      print("All retry attempts failed.")
      return None
```

### 3. Comprehensive Logging

Logging helps you debug issues without re-running the entire script.

* **Use the `logging` Module** : Configure a logger to record key events, such as when a scrape starts, when a page is successfully fetched, when data is saved, and especially when an error occurs.
  **Python**

```
  import logging

  # Configure logging
  logging.basicConfig(
      level=logging.INFO,
      format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
      filename='scraper.log', # Log to a file
      filemode='a'
  )

  logging.info("Starting the IMDB scraper...")
  try:
      # ... your scraping logic ...
      logging.info("Successfully scraped and saved data.")
  except Exception as e:
      logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}", exc_info=True)
```

### 4. Data Validation

Ensure the data you collect is accurate and in the expected format before saving it. Use libraries like **Pydantic** for complex validation or simple checks for basic scripts.

**Python**

```
# Simple validation check
if price.startswith('‚Çπ') and rating.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
    # Data looks valid, proceed to save
    pass
else:
    logging.warning(f"Invalid data found: Price='{price}', Rating='{rating}'")

```

By implementing this standardized approach, we can significantly improve the quality and reliability of our web scraping collection.
